# Flappy Bird: Modern Graphics for a Classic Game

This project brings to life the classic iPhone game Flappy Bird by giving it a proper three-dimensional aesthetic. In this project, we reimplemented all of the features of the classic game, except that while the original gameâ€™s graphics are retro, pixelated, and two-dimensional, our game uses three-dimensional meshes, lighting, and shadows for a sharper, more realistic look.

Created by Julia Ruskin and Caroline di Vittorio for Princeton's COS426: Computer Graphics, Spring 2022.
